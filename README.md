*<ins> Analysis for Module 4 - Python and Pandas</ins>*



**Overview of the school district analysis:** 

The purpose of this analysis is to decide whether or not there has been any cheating amongst the 9th graders at Thomas High School. The school board suspects this group of students have been cheating but need proof. To do this we are asked to replace the 9th grade Thomas High schoolers math and reading scores with NaN and conduct a school district analysis. Comparing the different high schools will determine if the 9th graders at Thomas High School cheated. 

* How is the district summary affected?
The district summary with all students shows the average math score as 78.9 and average reading score as 81.8. This is our baseline. If the Thomas High School ninth-graders didn't cheat we will see similar results across the board. The average math scores at Thomas High School within the new district summary was higher than the average - average math score was 83.3 and average reading score was 83.8. The reading score didn't see too much of a difference but the math score saw an increase in roughly 4 points.
